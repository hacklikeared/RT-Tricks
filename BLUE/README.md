# Presentation Payloads

Hello Blueteamer,

[Here](Payloads) you can find 5 of the 6 payloads which were used in the presentation.

The final 6th payload can be found [here](https://hacklikea.red/file.html) as it was too big for github.

Have fun testing them against you AV of choice, creating detection rules and/or reversing them.
