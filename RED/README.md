# Introduction to Installing and Using Mythic

Hello Redteamer,

In this short 3 part tutorial we will go over:
1. [Installing Mythic on an Ubuntu Machine](install.md)
1. [Generating a Payload](payload.md)
1. [Running the Agent on a Victim and Executing Commands](agent.md)

Note: Use a Ubuntu machine with at least 50 GB of storage, 2 Cores and 2 MB of RAM on which to install Mythic.

Note 2: In order to test the agents on a Windows system, you can get an Evaluation VM from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)

### Disclaimer:
As Mythic and its C2 agents are considered malware, please do not install or run them on "Production" systems.
